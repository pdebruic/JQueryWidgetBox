ignoreTimeZone: aBoolean

" 
When parsing ISO8601 dates, whether UTC offsets should be ignored while processing event source data.

Boolean, default: true
The default is true, which means the UTC offset for all ISO8601 dates will be ignored. For example, the date '2008-11-05T08:15:30-05:00' will be processed as November 5th, 2008 at 8:15am in the local offset of the browser.

If you are using ISO8601 dates with UTC offsets, chances are you want them processed. You must set this option to false. In the future, the default for this option will probably be changed to false.
