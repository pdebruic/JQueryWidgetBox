callbacks
onUnSelect: aCallback
	"
A callback that will fire when the current selection is cleared.

function( view )

A selection might be cleared for a number of reasons:

   1.

      The user clicks away from the current selection (doesn't happen when unselectAuto is false).
   2.

      The user makes a new selection. The unselect callback will be fired before the new selection occurs.
   3.

      The user moves forward or backward in the current view, or switches to a new view.
   4.

      The unselect method is called through the API.
