	"The initial date-of-month when the calendar loads.

Integer

This option only matters for the week & day views. Month view does not need this option, because month view always displays the entire month from start to finish.

If date is unspecified, and year/month are set to the current year/month, then the calendar will start on the current date. If date is unspecified, and year/month are not set to the current year/month, then the calendar will start on the first of the month."
