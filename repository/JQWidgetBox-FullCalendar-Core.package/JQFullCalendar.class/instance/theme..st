options
theme: aBoolean
	"Enables/disables use of jQuery UI theming.

Boolean, default: false

Once you enable theming with true, you still need to include the CSS file for the theme you want. For example, if you just downloaded a theme from the jQuery UI Themeroller, you need to put a <link> tag in your page's <head>."
