selectHelper: aBoolean
	"
Whether to draw a placeholder event while the user is dragging.

Boolean/Function, default: false

This option only applies to the agenda views.

A value of true will draw a placeholder event while the user is dragging (similar to what Google Calendar does for its week and day views). A value of false (the default) will draw the standard highlighting over each cell.

A function can also be specified for drawing custom elements. It will be given 2 arguments: the selection's start date and end date (Date objects). It must return a DOM element that will be used.
