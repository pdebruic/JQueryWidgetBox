So this class should highlight some of the features of FullCalendar (http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/).

You can set all of the initialization options.  You can create an event by clicking on the calendar in the month view, or by selecting a range in the week or day calendar.  You can edit and event by clicking on it. You can extend, shorten, and move an event to a different time.  The collection 'events' is re-initialized each time the calendar is drawn.  You could set it to a session variable to keep your changes between ajax reloads of the calendar.
